# BigJoke

This project is a simple joke telling app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The app has been build as part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

The app consists of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.   The app as two product flavors, a paid and a free variant. In the free flavor, prior to the joke, an AdMob interstitial is shown as an example how to monetize an app.
